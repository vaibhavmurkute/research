### 1. [Demographics of Time Poverty: An Analysis of Gender Disparity and Temporal Stability in U.S. Time Use (2020–2024)](demographics-of-time-poverty/)
- **Abstract**: This study assesses the gender disparity and temporal stability of time poverty using five years of pooled data (2020–2024) from the American Time Use Survey [(ATUS)](https://www.bls.gov/tus/). Time-poverty is rigorously defined as the intersection of insufficient time for necessary self-maintenance (Personal Care) and discretionary enjoyment (Leisure Time), quantified by the 25th percentile of each distribution. Pearson’s χ2 test and the Mantel-Haenszel (MH) test were employed to evaluate the hypotheses. Results show no statistically significant change in the absolute prevalence of time-poverty over the 2020–2024 period (χ2 = 3.25,p = 0.5176). However, a highly significant gender disparity exists, with the odds of a male being time-poor being 21.1% lower than for a female (Common OR =0.789; 95% CI: 0.733–0.850). These findings establish that time poverty is a stable, gendered phenomenon during this period.
